# Software

Software developed by the CSSR4Africa consortium for the Pepper robot can be accessed by cloning the [CSSR4Africa repository on GitHub](https://github.com/cssr4africa/cssr4africa).

Instructions on how to install the software can be found in [Deliverable D3.3](https://cssr4africa.github.io/deliverables/CSSR4Africa_Deliverable_D3.3.pdf).  

Since the project has just begun, the software comprises only a few rudimentary diagnostic routines at present.
