# Software

Software developed by the CSSR4Africa consortium for the Pepper robot can be accessed by cloning the [CSSR4Africa repository on GitHub](https://github.com/cssr4africa/cssr4africa).

Some modules used machine learning. These models are available on   [CSSR4Africa repository on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/cssr4africa/cssr4africa_models/tree/main).

Some modules have very large unit test data sets. These data sets are also available on   [CSSR4Africa repository on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/cssr4africa/cssr4africa_unit_tests_data_files/tree/main).

Instructions on how to install the software can be found in [Deliverable D3.3](https://cssr4africa.github.io/deliverables/CSSR4Africa_Deliverable_D3.3.pdf).  

Since the project has just begun, the software comprises only a few rudimentary diagnostic routines at present.
