# About the CSSR4Africa Project

 CSSR4Africa is a three-year research project to develop culturally sensitive social robotics for Africa (CSSR4Africa). The objectives of the project are
  (i) to identify the verbal and non-verbal social and cultural norms of human interaction that are prevalent in countries in Africa,
    (ii) to encapsulate them in the behavioural patterns of social robots so that they  can engage with African people in a manner that is consistent with their expectations of acceptable social interaction, and
    (iii) to demonstrate these culturally-sensitive social robot behaviours in two use cases: one for giving a tour of a university laboratory, and one for assisting and giving directions to visitors at the reception of a university.
    In order to ensure that the project objectives can be achieved in the time available, we restrict the scope of the project to the cultures and social practices that are prevalent in Rwanda and South Africa.

 The figure above shows the rationale for a culturally <strong> sensitive </strong> robot. It is based on Fig. 1 in (Bruno et al., 2017) which explains the rationale for a culturally <strong>competent</strong> robot. The difference is  that competence entails the ability of learn the specific cultural preferences of individuals and adapt its behavior accordingly, whereas sensitivity only entails the ability to exhibit culturally sensitive behavior based on the general cultural preferences of a population using on ethnographic data stored in a cultural knowledge base.
