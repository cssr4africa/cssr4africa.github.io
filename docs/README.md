# The CSSR4Africa Project

While AI fuels creative invention, it is innovation that produces social and economic benefits through widespread adoption and a substantial change in the practices of people.  Successful innovation  depends on physical infrastructure, but it also depends on social infrastructure: the  conventions that govern  people's behaviour,  the practices they find acceptable and unacceptable, and their sense of what is trustworthy. Cultural competence, i.e., an awareness of social norms and cultural expectations, is a key element in establishing acceptance.

The  need for artificial intelligence technology to be culturally competent is perhaps best exemplified by the field of social robotics, a field that is growing quickly.[^1]

Social robots serve people in a variety of ways: they operate in everyday environments, often in open spaces such as hospitals, exhibition centres, and airports, providing  assistance to people, typically in the form of advice, guidance, or information.  The people who interact with these robots have no special training and they expect a robot to be able to interact with them on **their** terms, not the robot's.

Based on ethnographic research to acquire cultural knowledge about acceptable modes of communication, the CSSR4Africa project will equip  Pepper robots with the ability to interact respectfully with people in Africa using spatial, non-verbal, and verbal modes of communication.
